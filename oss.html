<h1>Third party licenses</h1>
<hr>
This game is built on the Godot Engine (https://godotengine.org/), version 3.2.3, using Godot's Mono integration. We use official builds and export templates which are available at https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.2.3/mono/<br><br>
Source code for Godot is available at https://github.com/godotengine/godot, and source code for Mono is available at https://github.com/mono/mono.<br><br>
Please note that we are only students, not lawyers - we have tried our best to locate and reference third party/open source code below.<br><br>

Godot uses various pieces of third party open source components - you can find a list of these below, along with copyright statements and license information.<br>

<br>
 By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree<br>
 to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons<br>
 Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public<br>
 License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a<br>
 contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your<br>
 acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You<br>
 such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from<br>
 making the Licensed Material available under these terms and<br>
 conditions.<br>
<br>
 Section 1 -- Definitions.<br>
<br>
 a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar<br>
 Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material<br>
 and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,<br>
 arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring<br>
 permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the<br>
 Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed<br>
 Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,<br>
 Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is<br>
 synched in timed relation with a moving image.<br>
<br>
 b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright<br>
 and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in<br>
 accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.<br>
<br>
 c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights<br>
 closely related to copyright including, without limitation,<br>
 performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database<br>
 Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or<br>
 categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights<br>
 specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar<br>
 Rights.<br>
<br>
 d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the<br>
 absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws<br>
 fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright<br>
 Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international<br>
 agreements.<br>
<br>
 e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or<br>
 any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights<br>
 that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.<br>
<br>
 f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,<br>
 or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public<br>
 License.<br>
<br>
 g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the<br>
 terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to<br>
 all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the<br>
 Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.<br>
<br>
 h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights<br>
 under this Public License.<br>
<br>
 i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or<br>
 process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such<br>
 as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,<br>
 dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material<br>
 available to the public including in ways that members of the<br>
 public may access the material from a place and at a time<br>
 individually chosen by them.<br>
<br>
 j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright<br>
 resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of<br>
 the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,<br>
 as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially<br>
 equivalent rights anywhere in the world.<br>
<br>
 k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights<br>
 under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.<br>
<br>
 Section 2 -- Scope.<br>
<br>
 a. License grant.<br>
<br>
 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,<br>
 the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,<br>
 non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to<br>
 exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:<br>
<br>
 a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or<br>
 in part; and<br>
<br>
 b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.<br>
<br>
 2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where<br>
 Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public<br>
 License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with<br>
 its terms and conditions.<br>
<br>
 3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section<br>
 6(a).<br>
<br>
 4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The<br>
 Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in<br>
 all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,<br>
 and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The<br>
 Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or<br>
 authority to forbid You from making technical modifications<br>
 necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including<br>
 technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective<br>
 Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,<br>
 simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)<br>
 (4) never produces Adapted Material.<br>
<br>
 5. Downstream recipients.<br>
<br>
 a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every<br>
 recipient of the Licensed Material automatically<br>
 receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the<br>
 Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this<br>
 Public License.<br>
<br>
 b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose<br>
 any additional or different terms or conditions on, or<br>
 apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the<br>
 Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the<br>
 Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed<br>
 Material.<br>
<br>
 6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or<br>
 may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You<br>
 are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected<br>
 with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,<br>
 the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as<br>
 provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).<br>
<br>
 b. Other rights.<br>
<br>
 1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not<br>
 licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,<br>
 privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to<br>
 the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to<br>
 assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited<br>
 extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed<br>
 Rights, but not otherwise.<br>
<br>
 2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this<br>
 Public License.<br>
<br>
 3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to<br>
 collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed<br>
 Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society<br>
 under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory<br>
 licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly<br>
 reserves any right to collect such royalties.<br>
<br>
 Section 3 -- License Conditions.<br>
<br>
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the<br>
 following conditions.<br>
<br>
 a. Attribution.<br>
<br>
 1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified<br>
 form), You must:<br>
<br>
 a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor<br>
 with the Licensed Material:<br>
<br>
 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed<br>
 Material and any others designated to receive<br>
 attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by<br>
 the Licensor (including by pseudonym if<br>
 designated);<br>
<br>
 ii. a copyright notice;<br>
<br>
 iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;<br>
<br>
 iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of<br>
 warranties;<br>
<br>
 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the<br>
 extent reasonably practicable;<br>
<br>
 b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and<br>
 retain an indication of any previous modifications; and<br>
<br>
 c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this<br>
 Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or<br>
 hyperlink to, this Public License.<br>
<br>
 2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any<br>
 reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in<br>
 which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be<br>
 reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or<br>
 hyperlink to a resource that includes the required<br>
 information.<br>
<br>
 3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the<br>
 information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent<br>
 reasonably practicable.<br>
<br>
 4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's<br>
 License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted<br>
 Material from complying with this Public License.<br>
<br>
 Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.<br>
<br>
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that<br>
 apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:<br>
<br>
 a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right<br>
 to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial<br>
 portion of the contents of the database;<br>
<br>
 b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database<br>
 contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database<br>
 Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database<br>
 Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and<br>
<br>
 c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share<br>
 all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.<br>
<br>
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not<br>
 replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed<br>
 Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.<br>
<br>
 Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
 a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE<br>
 EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS<br>
 AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF<br>
 ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,<br>
 IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,<br>
 WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
 PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,<br>
 ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT<br>
 KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT<br>
 ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
<br>
 b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE<br>
 TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,<br>
 NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,<br>
 INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,<br>
 COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR<br>
 USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN<br>
 ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR<br>
 DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR<br>
 IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
<br>
 c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided<br>
 above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent<br>
 possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and<br>
 waiver of all liability.<br>
<br>
 Section 6 -- Term and Termination.<br>
<br>
 a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and<br>
 Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with<br>
 this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License<br>
 terminate automatically.<br>
<br>
 b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under<br>
 Section 6(a), it reinstates:<br>
<br>
 1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided<br>
 it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the<br>
 violation; or<br>
<br>
 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.<br>
<br>
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any<br>
 right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations<br>
 of this Public License.<br>
<br>
 c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the<br>
 Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop<br>
 distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so<br>
 will not terminate this Public License.<br>
<br>
 d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public<br>
 License.<br>
<br>
 Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.<br>
<br>
 a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different<br>
 terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.<br>
<br>
 b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the<br>
 Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and<br>
 independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.<br>
<br>
 Section 8 -- Interpretation.<br>
<br>
 a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and<br>
 shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose<br>
 conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully<br>
 be made without permission under this Public License.<br>
<br>
 b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is<br>
 deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the<br>
 minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision<br>
 cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License<br>
 without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and<br>
 conditions.<br>
<br>
 c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no<br>
 failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the<br>
 Licensor.<br>
<br>
 d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted<br>
 as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities<br>
 that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal<br>
 processes of any jurisdiction or authority.</li>

<br>
 Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,<br>

 (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)<br>
     Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,<br>
     modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its<br>
     Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or<br>

 (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer<br>
     for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its<br>
     Contributions or its Contributor Version.<br>
<br>
 2.2. Effective Date<br>
<br>
 The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution<br>
 become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first<br>
 distributes such Contribution.<br>
<br>
 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope<br>
<br>
 The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under<br>
 this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the<br>
 distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.<br>
 Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a<br>
 Contributor:<br>
<br>
 (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;<br>
     or<br>
<br>
 (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's<br>
     modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its<br>
     Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor<br>
     Version); or<br>
<br>
 (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of<br>
     its Contributions.<br>
<br>
 This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,<br>
 or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with<br>
 the notice requirements in Section 3.4).<br>
<br>
 2.4. Subsequent Licenses<br>
<br>
 No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to<br>
 distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this<br>
 License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if<br>
 permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).<br>
<br>
 2.5. Representation<br>
<br>
 Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its<br>
 Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights<br>
 to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.<br>
<br>
 2.6. Fair Use<br>
<br>
 This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under<br>
 applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other<br>
 equivalents.<br>
<br>
 2.7. Conditions<br>
<br>
 Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted<br>
 in Section 2.1.<br>
<br>
 3. Responsibilities<br>
 -------------------<br>
<br>
 3.1. Distribution of Source Form<br>
<br>
 All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any<br>
 Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under<br>
 the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source<br>
 Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this<br>
 License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not<br>
 attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code<br>
 Form.<br>
<br>
 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form<br>
<br>
 If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:<br>
<br>
 (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code<br>
     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of<br>
     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code<br>
     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more<br>
     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and<br>
<br>
 (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this<br>
     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the<br>
     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter<br>
     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.<br>
<br>
 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work<br>
<br>
 You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,<br>
 provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for<br>
 the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered<br>
 Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the<br>
 Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this<br>
 License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software<br>
 under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of<br>
 the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered<br>
 Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary<br>
 License(s).<br>
<br>
 3.4. Notices<br>
<br>
 You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices<br>
 (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,<br>
 or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of<br>
 the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to<br>
 the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.<br>
<br>
 3.5. Application of Additional Terms<br>
<br>
 You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,<br>
 indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered<br>
 Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on<br>
 behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any<br>
 such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by<br>
 You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any<br>
 liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,<br>
 indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional<br>
 disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any<br>
 jurisdiction.<br>
<br>
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation<br>
 ---------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br>
 License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to<br>
 statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with<br>
 the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)<br>
 describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must<br>
 be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered<br>
 Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute<br>
 or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a<br>
 recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br>
<br>
 5. Termination<br>
 --------------<br>
<br>
 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically<br>
 if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become<br>
 compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular<br>
 Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such<br>
 Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an<br>
 ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the<br>
 non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have<br>
 come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular<br>
 Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor<br>
 notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the<br>
 first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License<br>
 from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after<br>
 Your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent<br>
 infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,<br>
 counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version<br>
 directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to<br>
 You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section<br>
 2.1 of this License shall terminate.<br>
<br>
 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all<br>
 end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which<br>
 have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License<br>
 prior to termination shall survive termination.<br>

 *  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *<br>
 *  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *<br>
 *  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *<br>
 *  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *<br>
 *  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *<br>
 *  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *<br>
 *  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *<br>
 *  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *<br>
 *  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *<br>
 *  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *<br>
 *  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *<br>
 *                                                                      *<br>

 *  7. Limitation of Liability                                          *<br>
 *  --------------------------                                          *<br>

 *  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *<br>
 *  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *<br>
 *  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *<br>
 *  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         *<br>
 *  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *<br>
 *  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *<br>
 *  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    *<br>
 *  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party      *<br>
 *  shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This   *<br>
 *  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   *<br>
 *  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       *<br>
 *  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *<br>
 *  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *<br>
 *  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *<br>

 *                                                                      *<br>
 ************************************************************************<br>
<br>
 8. Litigation<br>
 -------------<br>
<br>
 Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the<br>
 courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal<br>
 place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that<br>
 jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.<br>
 Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring<br>

 PREAMBLE<br>
 The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide<br>
 development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation<br>
 efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and<br>
 open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership<br>
 with others.<br>
<br>
 The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and<br>
 redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The<br>
 fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,<br>
 redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved<br>
 names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,<br>
 however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The<br>
 requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply<br>
 to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.<br>
<br>
 DEFINITIONS<br>
 "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright<br>
 Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may<br>
 include source files, build scripts and documentation.<br>
<br>
 "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the<br>
 copyright statement(s).<br>
<br>
 "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as<br>
 distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).<br>
<br>
 "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,<br>

 Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a<br>
 new environment.<br>
<br>
 "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical<br>
 writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.<br>
<br>
 PERMISSION & CONDITIONS<br>
 Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining<br>
 a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,<br>
 redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font<br>

<br>
 1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,<br>

 binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.<br>
<br>
 3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font<br>
 Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding<br>
 Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as<br>
 presented to the users.<br>
<br>
 4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font<br>
 Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any<br>

 permission.<br>
<br>
 5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,<br>
 must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be<br>

 Introduction<br>
 ============<br>
<br>
 The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;<br>
 some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,<br>
 various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the<br>
 FreeType Project.<br>
<br>
 This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and<br>
 which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license<br>
 affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,<br>
 documentation and makefiles, at the very least.<br>
<br>
 This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG<br>
 (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion<br>
 and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products<br>
 alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:<br>
<br>
   o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be<br>
     interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)<br>
<br>
   o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or<br>
     full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)<br>
<br>
   o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use<br>
     it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge<br>
     somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the<br>
     FreeType code. (`credits')<br>
<br>
 We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this<br>
 software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.<br>
 We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and<br>
 assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.<br>
<br>
 .<br>
 Legal Terms<br>
 ===========<br>
<br>
 0. Definitions<br>
 --------------<br>
<br>
 Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',<br>
 and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally<br>
 distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and<br>
 Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,<br>
 beta or final release.<br>
<br>
 `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where<br>
 `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source<br>
 code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.<br>
 This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType<br>
 engine'.<br>
<br>
 This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original<br>
 FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and<br>
 documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its<br>
 original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.<br>
 If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by<br>
 this license, you must contact us to verify this.<br>
<br>
 The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,<br>
 Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as<br>
 specified below.<br>
<br>
 1. No Warranty<br>
 --------------<br>
<br>
 THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
 KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,<br>
 WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR<br>
 PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS<br>
 BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO<br>
 USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.<br>
<br>
 2. Redistribution<br>
 -----------------<br>
<br>
 This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and<br>
 irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,<br>
 display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and<br>
 sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code<br>
 forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to<br>
 authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted<br>
 herein, subject to the following conditions:<br>
<br>
   o Redistribution  of source code  must retain this  license file<br>
     (`LICENSE.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes<br>
     to   the  original   files  must   be  clearly   indicated  in<br>
     accompanying  documentation.   The  copyright notices  of  the<br>
     unaltered, original  files must be preserved in  all copies of<br>
     source files.<br>
<br>
   o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that<br>
     states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the<br>
     FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also<br>
     encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your<br>
     documentation, though this isn't mandatory.<br>
<br>
 These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on<br>
 the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use<br>
 our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid<br>
 to us.<br>
<br>
 3. Advertising<br>
 --------------<br>
<br>
 Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use<br>
 the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional<br>
 purposes without specific prior written permission.<br>
<br>
 We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the<br>
 following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation<br>
 or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',<br>
 `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.<br>
<br>
 As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to<br>
 accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted<br>
 material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the<br>
 authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.<br>
 Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType<br>
 Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms<br>
 of this license.<br>
<br>
 4. Contacts<br>
 -----------<br>

 There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:<br>
<br>
   o freetype@freetype.org<br>
<br>
     Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as<br>
     future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.<br>

 CC0 1.0 Universal<br>
<br>
 Statement of Purpose<br>
<br>
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer<br>
 exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and<br>
 subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of<br>
 authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").<br>
<br>
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the<br>
 purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific<br>
 works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later<br>
 claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse<br>
 and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any<br>
 purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may<br>
 contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the<br>
 further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain<br>
 reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and<br>
 efforts of others.<br>
<br>
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation<br>
 of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a<br>
 Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright<br>
 and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work<br>
 and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her<br>
 Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal<br>
 effect of CC0 on those rights.<br>
<br>
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be<br>
 protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and<br>
 Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited<br>
 to, the following:<br>
<br>
 i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,<br>
 and translate a Work;<br>
<br>
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);<br>
<br>
 iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness<br>
 depicted in a Work;<br>
<br>
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,<br>
 subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;<br>
<br>
 v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in<br>
 a Work;<br>
<br>
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the<br>
 European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal<br>
 protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,<br>
 including any amended or successor version of such directive); and<br>
<br>
 vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world<br>
 based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.<br>
<br>
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,<br>
 applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and<br>
 unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright<br>
 and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now<br>
 known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of<br>
 action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum<br>
 duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time<br>
 extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of<br>
 copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation<br>
 commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes<br>
 the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the<br>
 detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver<br>
 shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or<br>
 any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work<br>
 by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.<br>
<br>
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be<br>
 judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver<br>
 shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account<br>
 Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver<br>
 is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,<br>
 non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and<br>
 unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in<br>
 the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration<br>
 provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)<br>
 in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any<br>
 purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or<br>
 promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as<br>
 of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the<br>
 License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under<br>
 applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not<br>
 invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby<br>
 affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining<br>
 Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims<br>
 and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to<br>
 Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.<br>
<br>
 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.<br>
<br>
 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,<br>
 surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.<br>
<br>
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties<br>
 of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,<br>
 including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness<br>
 for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or<br>
 other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not<br>
 discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.<br>
<br>
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons<br>
 that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation<br>
 any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer<br>
 disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions<br>
 or other rights required for any use of the Work.<br>
<br>
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a<br>
 party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this<br>

Distribution Obligations.<br><br><br><br>     3.1. Application of License.<br><br>     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are<br><br>     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation<br><br>     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be<br><br>     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version<br><br>     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a<br><br>     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You<br><br>     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code<br><br>     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this<br><br>     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include<br><br>     an additional document offering the additional rights described in<br><br>     Section 3.5.<br><br><br><br>     3.2. Availability of Source Code.<br><br>     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be<br><br>     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License<br><br>     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted<br><br>     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an<br><br>     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic<br><br>     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)<br><br>     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six<br><br>     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification<br><br>     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for<br><br>     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the<br><br>     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.<br><br><br><br>     3.3. Description of Modifications.<br><br>     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a<br><br>     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and<br><br>     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that<br><br>     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original<br><br>     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the<br><br>     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an<br><br>     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the<br><br>     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.<br><br><br><br>     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters<br><br>          (a) Third Party Claims.<br><br>          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's<br><br>          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights<br><br>          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,<br><br>          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code<br><br>          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the<br><br>          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will<br><br>          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after<br><br>          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,<br><br>          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies<br><br>          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps<br><br>          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)<br><br>          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered<br><br>          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.<br><br><br><br>          (b) Contributor APIs.<br><br>          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming<br><br>          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which<br><br>          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must<br><br>          also include this information in the LEGAL file.<br><br><br><br>               (c)    Representations.<br><br>          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to<br><br>          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's<br><br>          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or<br><br>          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by<br><br>          this License.<br><br><br><br>     3.5. Required Notices.<br><br>     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source<br><br>     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source<br><br>     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a<br><br>     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely<br><br>     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)<br><br>     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in<br><br>     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation<br><br>     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership<br><br>     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to<br><br>     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability<br><br>     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You<br><br>     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial<br><br>     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than<br><br>     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is<br><br>     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial<br><br>     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the<br><br>     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,<br><br>     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br><br><br><br>     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br><br>     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the<br><br>     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,<br><br>     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of<br><br>     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,<br><br>     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the<br><br>     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included<br><br>     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or<br><br>     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the<br><br>     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered<br><br>     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may<br><br>     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in<br><br>     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the<br><br>     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's<br><br>     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this<br><br>     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different<br><br>     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ<br><br>     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial<br><br>     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the<br><br>     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by<br><br>     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such<br><br>     terms You offer.<br><br><br><br>     3.7. Larger Works.<br><br>     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code<br><br>     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger<br><br>     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the<br><br>     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.<br><br><br><br>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.<br><br><br><br>     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br><br>     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to<br><br>     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with<br><br>     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)<br><br>     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description<br><br>     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must<br><br>     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the<br><br>     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be<br><br>     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to<br><br>     understand it.<br><br><br><br>5. Application of this License.<br><br><br><br>     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has<br><br>     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.<br><br><br><br>6. Versions of the License.<br><br><br><br>     6.1. New Versions.<br><br>     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised<br><br>     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version<br><br>     will be given a distinguishing version number.<br><br><br><br>     6.2. Effect of New Versions.<br><br>     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the<br><br>     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that<br><br>     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms<br><br>     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one<br><br>     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to<br><br>     Covered Code created under this License.<br><br><br><br>     6.3. Derivative Works.<br><br>     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may<br><br>     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code<br><br>     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that<br><br>     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",<br><br>     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your<br><br>     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)<br><br>     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license<br><br>     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and<br><br>     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial<br><br>     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in<br><br>     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of<br><br>     this License.)<br><br><br><br>7.

THIS DISCLAIMER<br><br>     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF<br><br>     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.<br><br><br><br>8. TERMINATION.<br><br><br><br>     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br><br>     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure<br><br>     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All<br><br>     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall<br><br>     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their<br><br>     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License<br><br>     shall survive.<br><br><br><br>     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement<br><br>     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer<br><br>     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom<br><br>     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:<br><br><br><br>     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly<br><br>     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such<br><br>     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License<br><br>     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,<br><br>     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)<br><br>     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable<br><br>     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such<br><br>     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to<br><br>     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days<br><br>     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not<br><br>     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim<br><br>     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under<br><br>     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of<br><br>     the 60 day notice period specified above.<br><br><br><br>     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's<br><br>     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then<br><br>     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)<br><br>     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,<br><br>     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that<br><br>     Participant.<br><br><br><br>     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant<br><br>     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or<br><br>     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as<br><br>     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent<br><br>     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses<br><br>     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken<br><br>     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or<br><br>     license.<br><br><br><br>     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,<br><br>     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)<br><br>     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder<br><br>     prior to termination shall survive termination.<br><br><br><br>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.<br><br><br><br>     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT<br><br>     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL<br><br>     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,<br><br>     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR<br><br>     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY<br><br>     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,<br><br>     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER<br><br>     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN<br><br>     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF<br><br>     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY<br><br>     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW<br><br>     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE<br><br>     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO<br><br>     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br><br><br><br>10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.<br><br><br><br>     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in<br><br>     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer<br><br>     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such<br><br>     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48<br><br>     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),<br><br>     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those<br><br>     rights set forth herein.<br><br><br><br>11. MISCELLANEOUS.<br><br><br><br>     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject<br><br>     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be<br><br>     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent<br><br>     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by<br><br>     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if<br><br>     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.<br><br>     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,<br><br>     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United<br><br>     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be<br><br>     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern<br><br>     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,<br><br>     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including<br><br>     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and<br><br>     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on<br><br>     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.<br><br>     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract<br><br>     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this<br><br>     License.<br><br><br><br>12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.<br><br><br><br>     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is<br><br>     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,<br><br>     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to<br><br>     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such<br><br>     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or<br><br>     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.<br><br><br><br>13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.<br><br><br><br>     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as<br><br>     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial<br><br>     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under<br><br>     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified<br><br>     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.<br><br><br><br>EXHIBIT A -Mozilla Public License.<br><br><br><br>     ``The contents of this file are subject to the Mozilla Public License<br><br>     Version 1.1 (the "License"); you may not use this file except in<br><br>     compliance with the License.

For purposes of this Public License,<br><br>          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)<br><br>          (4) never produces Adapted Material.<br><br><br><br>       5. Downstream recipients.<br><br><br><br>            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every<br><br>               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically<br><br>               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the<br><br>               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this<br><br>               Public License.<br><br><br><br>            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose<br><br>               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or<br><br>               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the<br><br>               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the<br><br>               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed<br><br>               Material.<br><br><br><br>       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or<br><br>          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You<br><br>          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected<br><br>          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,<br><br>          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as<br><br>          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).<br><br><br><br>  b. Other rights.<br><br><br><br>       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not<br><br>          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,<br><br>          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to<br><br>          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to<br><br>          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited<br><br>          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed<br><br>          Rights, but not otherwise.<br><br><br><br>       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this<br><br>          Public License.<br><br><br><br>       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to<br><br>          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed<br><br>          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society<br><br>          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory<br><br>          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly<br><br>          reserves any right to collect such royalties.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Section 3 -- License Conditions.<br><br><br><br>Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the<br><br>following conditions.<br><br><br><br>  a. Attribution.<br><br><br><br>       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified<br><br>          form), You must:<br><br><br><br>            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor<br><br>               with the Licensed Material:<br><br><br><br>                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed<br><br>                    Material and any others designated to receive<br><br>                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by<br><br>                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if<br><br>                    designated);<br><br><br><br>                ii. a copyright notice;<br><br><br><br>               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;<br><br><br><br>                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of<br><br>                    warranties;<br><br><br><br>                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the<br><br>                    extent reasonably practicable;<br><br><br><br>            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and<br><br>               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and<br><br><br><br>            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this<br><br>               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or<br><br>               hyperlink to, this Public License.<br><br><br><br>       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any<br><br>          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in<br><br>          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be<br><br>          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or<br><br>          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required<br><br>          information.<br><br><br><br>       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the<br><br>          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent<br><br>          reasonably practicable.<br><br><br><br>       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's<br><br>          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted<br><br>          Material from complying with this Public License.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.<br><br><br><br>Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that<br><br>apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:<br><br><br><br>  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right<br><br>     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial<br><br>     portion of the contents of the database;<br><br><br><br>  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database<br><br>     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database<br><br>     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database<br><br>     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and<br><br><br><br>  c.

UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE<br><br>     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS<br><br>     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF<br><br>     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,<br><br>     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER.

The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided<br><br>     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent<br><br>     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and<br><br>     waiver of all liability.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Section 6 -- Term and Termination.<br><br><br><br>  a.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the<br><br>     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop<br><br>     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so<br><br>     will not terminate this Public License.<br><br><br><br>  d.

By contrast, the GNU General Public<br><br>License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br><br>software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<br><br>General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br><br>Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br><br>using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br><br>the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<br><br>your programs, too.<br><br><br><br>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br><br>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br><br>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br><br>this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br><br>if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br><br>in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br><br><br><br>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br><br>anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br><br>These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br><br>distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br><br><br><br>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br><br>gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br><br>you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br><br>source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<br><br>rights.<br><br><br><br>  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br><br>(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br><br>distribute and/or modify the software.<br><br><br><br>  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br><br>that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br><br>software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br><br>want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br><br>that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br><br>authors' reputations.<br><br><br><br>  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br><br>patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br><br>program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br><br>program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br><br>patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br><br><br><br>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br><br>modification follow.<br><br><br><br>		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br><br>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br><br><br><br>  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br><br>a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br><br>under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,<br><br>refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br><br>means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br><br>that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br><br>either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br><br>language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br><br>the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br><br><br><br>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br><br>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br><br>running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br><br>is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br><br>Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br><br>Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br><br><br><br>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br><br>source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br><br>conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br><br>copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br><br>notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br><br>and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br><br>along with the Program.<br><br><br><br>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br><br>you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br><br><br><br>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br><br>of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br><br>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br><br>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br><br><br><br>    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br><br>    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br><br><br><br>    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br><br>    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br><br>    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br><br>    parties under the terms of this License.<br><br><br><br>    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br><br>    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br><br>    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br><br>    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br><br>    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br><br>    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br><br>    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br><br>    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br><br>    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br><br>    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br><br><br><br>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br><br>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br><br>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br><br>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br><br>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br><br>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br><br>on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br><br>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br><br>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br><br><br><br>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br><br>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br><br>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br><br>collective works based on the Program.<br><br><br><br>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br><br>with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br><br>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br><br>the scope of this License.<br><br><br><br>  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br><br>under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br><br>Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br><br><br><br>    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br><br>    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br><br>    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br><br><br><br>    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br><br>    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br><br>    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br><br>    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br><br>    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br><br>    customarily used for software interchange; or,<br><br><br><br>    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br><br>    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<br><br>    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br><br>    received the program in object code or executable form with such<br><br>    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br><br><br><br>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br><br>making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<br><br>code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br><br>associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br><br>control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<br><br>special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br><br>anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br><br>form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br><br>operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br><br>itself accompanies the executable.<br><br><br><br>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br><br>access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br><br>access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br><br>distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br><br>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br><br><br><br>  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br><br>except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<br><br>otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br><br>void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br><br>However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br><br>this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br><br>parties remain in full compliance.<br><br><br><br>  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br><br>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br><br>distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<br><br>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br><br>modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br><br>Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br><br>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br><br>the Program or works based on it.<br><br><br><br>  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br><br>Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br><br>original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br><br>these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br><br>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br><br>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br><br>this License.<br><br><br><br>  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br><br>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br><br>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br><br>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br><br>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br><br>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br><br>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br><br>may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<br><br>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br><br>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br><br>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br><br>refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br><br><br><br>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br><br>any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br><br>apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br><br>circumstances.<br><br><br><br>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br><br>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br><br>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br><br>integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br><br>implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br><br>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br><br>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br><br>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br><br>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br><br>impose that choice.<br><br><br><br>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br><br>be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br><br><br><br>  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br><br>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br><br>original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br><br>may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br><br>those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br><br>countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<br><br>the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br><br><br><br>  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br><br>of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br><br>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br><br>address new problems or concerns.<br><br><br><br>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.
